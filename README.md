# 🚢 Data Preprocessing &  Web Scraping 

This repository contains preprocessing scripts and web scraping code for two projects:

1. **Titanic Dataset**
2. **Web Scraping Datasets** (`PakWheels` and `ShopHive`)

---

## 📊 Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival status.
It is commonly used for classification tasks such as predicting survival based on features like age, gender, class, etc.
