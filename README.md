Titanic Dataset Preprocessing

Overview

This repository contains preprocessing scripts for the Titanic dataset. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting categorical data, and preparing the dataset for machine learning models. The goal is to ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival status. The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks such as predicting survival based on different features.

Preprocessing Steps

The preprocessing pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading

Reads the dataset using pandas.

Selects relevant columns for processing.

2. Handling Missing Values

Converts non-numeric values in Age, Fare, and other numerical columns to numeric.

Fills missing values in Age with the median.

Fills missing values in Embarked with the most frequent category.

Drops rows with missing values if necessary.

3. Encoding Categorical Variables

Converts categorical columns (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

4. Feature Selection

Selects key numerical columns (Age, Fare, Pclass, etc.) for further processing.

Removes redundant or highly correlated features if needed.

5. Normalization (Optional)

Provides an option to normalize numerical values for clustering or machine learning models.

Running the Preprocessing Script

To preprocess the dataset, run the following command:

python preprocess.py

This will generate a cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Usage

Modify preprocess.py to customize preprocessing steps.

Use the cleaned dataset for machine learning models or clustering algorithms.
